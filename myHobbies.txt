 I have become a bowler.  On a fluke my daughter joined the high school bowling team last year, and has now become a top bowler in her conference.  I have my own shoes and ball and go out practicing with her.  

I am an avid player of games and puzzles.  By myself I play a lot of math games like Ken Ken and Killer Sudoku.  With friends and family I play board games like King of Tokyo and Settlers of Catan, but nothing is better than a good game of Euchre.
